LiveSplit One is a version of LiveSplit that uses the multiplatform [livesplit-core](https://github.com/CryZe/livesplit-core) Library and Web Technologies like React and Electron to create a new LiveSplit experience that works on a lot of different platforms.

It is super early in development, so don't expect this to work yet.
